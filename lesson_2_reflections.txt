What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When initialize a repository, the .git folder is made so i can start managing all my metadata for that proyect, if i dont git init. i wonth be able to use git in that repository at all.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Its great that git has a staging area because i can choose how to make little bundles of files to commit, and i can see what files i havent track in my working area that are left. well done git creator :P lol

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
i just add the files in order to the staging are and commit the ones that are responsible for that change.
