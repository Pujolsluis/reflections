When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To keep a backup, and also to easly share my code and commits with other co-workers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because i would like to decide when to get the new changes from the respository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones from other peoples repositorys but keeping a track of it with Github.
Clones are the ones i make from repositorys i have authorisation to, enabling me to push to them and pull.
Branches are extensions of my production work so i can modify and add features at will without messing up the main product enabling me to in certain point to merge the new changes and make them part of production.
