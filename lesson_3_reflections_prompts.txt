When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To keep a backup, and also to easly share my code and commits with other co-workers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because i would like to decide when to get the new changes from the respository.
